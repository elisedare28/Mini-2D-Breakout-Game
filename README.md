## Introduction

This is a basic implementation of the classic Breakout game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to break all the bricks with the ball without letting the ball fall off the screen. You can control the paddle with your mouse / Left and Right Arrow Keys / Keys A and D to bounce the ball.

## Features

## Usage

- Move the mouse left and right within the canvas or use left/right arrow keys or keys A and D to control the paddle.
